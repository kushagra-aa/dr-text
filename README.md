# Dr. Text - Your Enhanced Text Editing Sidekick in VS Code

**From the creator of ['Wrap It'][wrapit] and an absolute hidden gem ['REMifyy'][remifyy]!**

Tired of repetitive text manipulations and wishing for more power at your fingertips within VS Code? **Dr. Text** is here to boost your productivity by providing a collection of handy text editing features, with a strong emphasis on leveraging VS Code's fantastic multi-cursor capabilities.

This extension aims to augment the built-in text editing prowess of VS Code, tackling those little frustrations and saving you precious time. As a fellow enthusiast of multi-cursor, I felt the need for more focused tools to streamline common tasks. More features are on the way!

## Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Case Conversion (`dr-text.caseConvert`)

Effortlessly transform the case of your selected text. Whether you're refactoring variable names or standardizing your writing, Dr. Text has you covered. Supports multiple cursors for simultaneous case changes across selections!

**Supported Cases:**

* `upperCase` (HELLO WORLD)
* `lowerCase` (hello world)
* `sentenceCase` (This is a sentence.)
* `titleCase` (This Is a Title Case Example)
* `snakeCase` (this_is_snake_case)
* `kebabCase` (this-is-kebab-case)
* `pascalCase` (ThisIsPascalCase)
* `camelCase` (thisIsCamelCase)
* `upperSnakeCase` (THIS_IS_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
* `screamingSnakeCase` (THIS-IS-SCREAMING-SNAKE-CASE)

**Use Cases:**

* Quickly standardize variable naming conventions (e.g., converting from `camelCase` to `pascalCase` across multiple variable declarations).
* Formatting titles and headings.
* Preparing text for different coding styles or output formats.

### üî¢ Log Cursor Numbers (`dr-text.logCursorNumbers`)

Streamline your debugging workflow! This command pastes sequential index numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) at each of your active cursors.

**Use Cases:**

* Easily identify the output of multiple `console.log()` statements when debugging loops or asynchronous operations.
* Quickly number list items or similar sequences across multiple lines.
* Best used with multiple cursors for maximum efficiency.

**Example:**

Select multiple instances of `console.log("Log: |")` and run this command to get:

```javascript
console.log("Log: 1")
console.log("Log: 2")
console.log("Log: 3")
// ... and so on
```

### ‚è™ Log Reverse Cursor Numbers (`dr-text.logReverseCursorNumbers`)

Similar to "Log Cursor Numbers," but pastes numbers in reverse order (e.g., if you have 5 cursors, it will paste 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).

**Use Cases:**

* Useful in scenarios where you need to identify the order of execution or elements in reverse.
* Works seamlessly with multiple cursors.

### üßπ Text Cleaning and Formatting (Coming Soon!)

Stay tuned for features that will help you clean and format your text with ease:

* Removing extra spaces.
* Trimming leading and trailing whitespace.
* Sorting lines alphabetically or numerically.
* Converting between tabs and spaces.
* Removing duplicate lines.

### üìä Text Statistics (Coming Soon!)

Gain insights into your text with upcoming statistical analysis tools, such as:

* Character frequency analysis.
